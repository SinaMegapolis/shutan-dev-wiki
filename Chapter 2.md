# Chapter 2: CPUs and Assembly

In Chapter 1 we mentioned how All data is numerical, meaning that things like 3D/2D graphics, Animations, Text, Music, and Input/Output are either numbers or can be turned into numbers. Thus all processing on said data boils down into doing a lot of math operations really fast. This is exactly what CPUs are designed for.

At a minimum, a CPU needs to do a couple of things:

- Perform math operations on Hex numbers 

- Do bit manipulation 

- Load values from memory or store them there

- Jump from one instruction in machine code to another instruction, either conditionally or unconditionally
